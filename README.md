# Channel-estimation-for-interference-mitigation-in-millimeter-wave-multi-cell-beamspace-MIMO-systems
This paper deals with the inter-cell interference (ICI) mitigation in the channel estimation process of millimeter-wave multi-cell beamspace multiple-input multiple-output systems. The in-cell channels and the ICI channels are estimated together and distinguished with the beam information. In addition, the beamspace channels are estimated with small error by utilizing the asymptotic property of the beamspace channels.
